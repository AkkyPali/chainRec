# chainRec

This repo includes a tensorflow implementation of the algorithm -- chainRec, proposed in the paper

`Mengting Wan, Julian McAuley, "Item Recommendation on Monotonic Behavior Chains", in Proc. of 2018 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys'18), Vancouver, Canada, Oct. 2018. `

We also contributed a new large-scale book review dataset -- Goodreads. Details of the dataset can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home).

If you would like to use our dataset, extend our algorithm, or use our source code, please consider citing our paper (listed above). Thanks!

Any questions please contact Mengting Wan (m5wan@ucsd.edu).

## TO-DO
Note: The source code cleaning has not been finished yet. I'm trying to finish it as soon as possible. Please stay tuned. -Mengting
